               <p id="pres">
                The Cambridge Dictionary defines a spoonerism as a mistake made when speaking in which the first sounds of two words are exchanged with each other to produce a not intended and usually funny meaning. (<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/fr/dictionnaire/anglais/spoonerism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)
               </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                 The Reverend William Spooner used to produce spoonerisms such as "a scoop of boy trouts" instead of what he meant to say - "a troop of boy scouts".
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p id="pres">
                  More generally, a spoonerism is a sentence that hides a hidden meaning, which is revealed by exchanging sounds.</br></br>

                  Often, to this inversion principle is added a salacious sense, with a hidden word which produces this effect.</br></br>

                  Here are some examples :
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Fighting a liar          
               </p>
               </blockquote>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Bat flattery
               </p>
               </blockquote>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                  I must mend the sail
               </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p id="pres">
                  The most successful spoonerisms hide the most incongruous ideas under the most harmless words.
               </p>
               <h1 id="pres">
                  An art of initiates ?
               </h1>
               <p id="pres">
                  In most cases, the spoonerism has a plump or rascal outcome. Some are not (and will never be) sensitive to this art.. There is no universal humor, and the spoonerism is probably not the most consensual humor! Spoonerisms are therefore exchanged between interlocutors receptive to this particular humor, which tends to make it an insider discipline.</br></br>

                  Another aspect may surprise beginners: the fact of not revealing the solution of spoonerisms directly. This is not intended to leave people in the blur, but to allow them to fully enjoy the discovery of the solution! Indeed, the solution is much funnier to the one who decodes it by himself.</br></br>
